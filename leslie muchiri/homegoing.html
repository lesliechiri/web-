        <h2 class="sam">TREATMENT AND ROLE OF WOMEN IN THE BOOK</h2>

      <p>In the book, oppression of women is not in order to make them feel weak but it is on the assumption of weakness. In regards to the roles women had in the community, care giving stood out.  Baaba despite being Effia’s stepmother she still took care of her and her son Fiifi. Maame took care if Esi and the rest of the family including Abonkuruma after she was beaten by Big Man. Effia was also a determined caregiver to Quey, since she did not want him to experience the same childhood that she experienced. Ness also took the responsibility of taking care of a girl from the plantation she worked in despite having no close relations to the girl. Esi also took care of Ness before they were separated. Ness also took care of Kojo before she sacrificed her life to save his after she gave him to Aku.
    </p>
    <p>Women are also portrayed as story tellers as seen by women like Tansi telling a tale to young Esi, Esi telling Ness stories and Effia always engaging Quey in some of her stories. It is difficult for women to find autonomy or jobs.
    </p>
    <p>In regards to the treatment of women, the fate of women was controlled by the men around them. Maame, Effia and Esi’s mother, was subjected to rape where she was working as a house girl and had to escape and go to her old village and leave her daughter behind. Effia was married off to a British soldier James Collins without her being consulted. Esi, Effia’s sister, is also sold to the same officer and sent to America and before she leaves is subjected to rape like many other women. The conditions in the dungeons did not favor them as they experienced harsh conditions ,starvation and some of them had their babies taken from them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="chairman">DIFFERENCE OF TREATMENT&ROLE OF WOMEN TODAY</h2>
    <p>In today’s time, women are treated differently in many ways but the main one is the fate of women is not controlled by men but by themselves. Women have the chance of becoming national and international leaders and their role of just being domestic care givers is looked past, since women are more than most people perceive them to be.
    </p>
    <p>Women like Angela Merkel, is a German Chancellor, since 2005 in a country that was ruled by Adolf Hitler a while back. Women have also become heads of state despite leadership roles in the book being entitled to the men. Theresa May who is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since 2016, Sheikh Hasina who is the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Ellen Johnson Sir leaf is the current president of Liberia, Dalia Grybuaskaite is the current President of Lithuania.
    </p>
    <p>The empowerment of women is important because women in power are prompted to support their fellow women. Some women have started start ups to support their fellow women. An example is AkiraChix to support women in Technology and another start up in Ghana to also support women in Tech. International women’s Day also aims for #Balance for Better#. Women have rights in this century and women are taught to believe in themselves and not tangled into a harsh mentality of being the weaker gender.
    </p>
    <p> They are taught to believe they can do so much men can do and if not so they can even do this things better . Mental slavery is not dominant in the 21st Century since women have a voice that can be heard. In conclusion the difference between both women is, we have free will and theirs was controlled.
