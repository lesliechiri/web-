     <h2>ROLE OF POLICE IN SOUTH AFRICA TODAY</h2>




     <p class="panel"><img src="img/sap.png" class="lisa">The role of police in the current South African era, like many police forces, is to maintain law and order. Since South Africa is a rainbow nation it accommodates both white and black without discrimination therefore respecting diversity. They also control traffic law enforcement on local roads to avoid congestion of vehicles. They also deal with protest action to make sure they are peaceful demonstrations to avoid instances of violence and looting leading to damage of property and loss of lives.
     </p>
     <p>The force consists of the Metro police and the South African police force.  The metro police work locally focusing mainly on the duties named above and the South African police force works more with the investigative part.
     </p>
     <p>The metro police account to the municipal government and are paid by the same whereas the police service account to the national ministry and are paid the national treasury.South Africa is a rainbow nation now therefore the force consists of both black and white.

     <h2>THE ROLE OF POLICE IN THE BOOK</h2>
     <img src="img/popo.jpg"><img src="img/unity.jpg">

     <P>The role of police in the book is quite different since the setting is in the apartheid era which was during a white supremacist system of government based on racial segregation, forced labor, and disenfranchisement of non whites to a tenuous democracy led by black majority. The police consisted of the whites whose main aim was to systematically disempower non whites who consisted of Indians, blacks and the colored race who were a mixed race.
     </P>

     <P>Their other role was to arrest people of different races who were found having illicit carnal intercourse with the other. If it was a native male found they would serve a prison sentence of a period not exceeding five years. If a native female was found in the same situation they would serve a prison sentence not exceeding four years, according to a law that was enacted in 1927 and was known as THE IMMORALITY ACT .The whites who were found in the same situation were given a free pass.
     </P>

     <P>The police also arrested the colored children since they were fruits of a forbidden act. The police also made sure the blacks stayed in the townships away from the suburbs which was a no go zone for the black community. The only time one could be seen around there is when they were going to work for them.
     </P>

     <P>During this time the police routinely massacred Soweto. There was no fairness if one was black they had to have a pass. Hardships in oneâ€™s own country.
     </P>
     


     <h2 class="life" >DIFFERENCE IN THE ROLE OF POLICE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND KENYA</h2>
     <p>The police in south Africa and Kenya now are not that different in their roles the only difference is  that the police in the Kenyan force are Kenyan only since we cannot be defined as a rainbow nation.
