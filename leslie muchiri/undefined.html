<p>“Mapenzi hayana mwenyewe, unaweza penda kijana au mzee”, that was the song playing in the background and at the time was familiar to everyone who knew the acclaimed Ruby. There she sat, sipping on a glass of pinnot grigio in a small rural town if France known as Vezelay. Her name was Mumbi, she had dark and abundant hair so glossy that it threw off the shine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion. She used to recall of the dark gloomy days in her motherland, voice of her mother saying she would amount to nothing and her abusive boyfriend Irungu running off with Mueni on the account that Kambas gave the best experiences, a sterotype that everyone was led to believe.</p>
<p> She was a small town girl who always had ambition and believed that she would rescue her folk from the ghetto. What were they if not only dreams. God was always on her mind being the facilitator of the PMC In church she was adored by all, but most of all by her grandmother who always called her, “Mumbi, nyina wa ruriri,” and would sometimes refer to her as, my name, since she was named after her. She left nothing to chance and always strived for the best. She finished her high school studies but could not afford college education and that is when she decided to take up a job as a bartender.</p>
<p>Despite being her mother’s local pub she worked there none the less. At first she felt isolated and lonely and felt the urgency to relate to the other bartenders but none of them liked her. She was the new kid in the block, young her curvilinear waist, dainty nose and halo-white teeth was the envy of all the others. She was not used to the frowsty smell of the place but all she used to say was ‘bora uhai’. The unbearable feeling of a dream that was once valid was now bereft of life. That’s when he walked in, with his jacaru hat. He was an old man, but you could see the young boy in him still yearning to return to his train set. It was as if his soul sat down on those little platforms with the tiny trees, waiting at the miniature station for the steady sound of turning wheels and puffs of steam. From the look people gave him one could tell his social and financial status. He sat down and one of the girls went on to serve him but he intercepted before she could ask him to order, “Njitira Mumbi”, she looked at him, sneared rolling her eyes. Mumbi diligently went on to take the order, little did she know her future was staring her right in the face.</p>
<p>He came from time to time, took an interest in her despite being 27 years her senior. He was the most polite caring and handsome man she ever came to know. He finally decided to tell her how he felt. He was a divorcee and nothing was holding him back. She got to know him gradually but her mother said that she could not accept money from a man who was only interested in stealing her daughter’s youth. She was in love, and when he proposed they relocate to France she couldn’t say no. she made sure all her siblings attended the best schools and gave them nothing short of the best. 10 years and three children down the line her mother never forgave her for choosing a stranger over her own family. What other choice did she have but sacrifice.  Their life was better was it not and by her side was the love of her life.</p>
